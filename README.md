## Abstract
As data and computing power have proliferated in recent decades, statistical modeling has become an important tool for understanding ecological patterns and processes. Statistical modeling in ecology faces two major challenges: first, ecological data may not conform to traditional methods, and second, professional ecologists often do not receive extensive statistical training. In response to these challenges, the journal *Ecology* has published many innovative statistical ecology papers that introduce novel modeling methods and provide accessible guides to statistical best practices. In this paper, we reflect on *Ecologyâ€™s* history and its role in the emergence of the subdiscipline of statistical ecology, which we define as the study of ecological systems using mathematical equations, probability, and empirical data. We showcase 33 influential statistical ecology papers that have been published in *Ecology* and in so doing comment on the evolution of the field. As data and computing power continue to increase, we anticipate continued growth in statistical ecology to tackle complex analyses and an expanding role for *Ecology* to publish innovative and influential papers, pushing forward the discipline and guiding practicing ecologists.
